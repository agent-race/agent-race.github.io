===================================

**LLM-PBE** is a toolkit to assess the data privacy of LLMs. It has the following features

- Comprehensive attack approaches (data extraction attacks, membership inference attacks, jailbreaking attacks, prompt injection attacks).
- Practical defense approaches (differential privacy, machine unlearning, defensive prompting).
- Multiple types of data (personally-identificable information, copywrited work, domain knowledge, prompts).
- Accessing different LLMs (GPT-3.5/4, HuggingFace, TogetherAI, etc).
